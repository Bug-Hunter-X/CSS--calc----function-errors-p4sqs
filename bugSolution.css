The corrected CSS uses proper spacing and operator precedence within the `calc()` function.  For example:

```css
width: calc(100% - 10px);
height: calc( (100vh - 50px)/2);
/* Proper spacing and parenthesis for complex calculations */
```

Avoid using unsupported operations within `calc()`, like mixing percentages and `em` units without proper considerations for context.  Always thoroughly test your CSS across different browsers and screen sizes to identify and address layout issues.
